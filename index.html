        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 6, 2025</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Expenza: Expense Tracker ("we", "our", or "the app") 
            collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Expenza is designed with privacy in mind. We collect and store the following information locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expense Data:</strong> Transaction amounts, dates, descriptions, categories, and payment modes</li>
            <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Currency settings, language preferences, default payment modes, and app settings</li>
            <li><strong>Book Data:</strong> Expense books you create to organize your expenses</li>
            <li><strong>Categories and Payment Modes:</strong> Custom categories and payment methods you create</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> All this data is stored locally on your device in an encrypted SQLite database. 
            We do not automatically collect or transmit this data to our servers.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Camera Permission</h2>
        <p>
            Expenza requests camera permission to enable QR code scanning functionality. This feature allows you to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scan QR codes for UPI payments</li>
            <li>Quickly extract payment information from QR codes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Camera Usage:</strong> The camera is only accessed when you explicitly use the QR code scanning feature. 
            We do not record, store, or transmit any camera images or video. All camera processing happens locally on your device, 
            and no camera data leaves your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can deny camera permission and still use all other features of the app. The camera permission is optional.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your expense data is stored locally on your device using SQLite database 
            with encryption. Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to back it up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Backup and Restore:</strong> You have the option to back up your data to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Save encrypted backup files to your device's storage</li>
            <li><strong>Google Drive:</strong> If you choose to connect your Google account, you can back up your data to Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Backups are encrypted before being stored. Only you can restore your backups using the app. 
            We do not have access to your backup files or their contents.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Google Sign-In</h2>
        <p>
            If you choose to use Google Sign-In, we use it solely for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authenticating your Google account to access Google Drive</li>
            <li>Enabling backup and restore functionality via Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We only request the minimum necessary permissions (email and Google Drive file access). 
            We do not use your Google account information for any other purpose.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Advertising</h2>
        <p>
            Expenza displays advertisements through:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads:</strong> Google's advertising network</li>
            <li><strong>Facebook Audience Network:</strong> Facebook's advertising network</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These advertising networks may collect information about your device and usage patterns to show relevant ads. 
            This information is collected by the advertising networks, not by us. Please refer to their privacy policies:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation" target="_blank">Facebook Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can remove ads by purchasing the premium version of the app through in-app purchase.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Internet and Network Permissions</h2>
        <p>

            <li>Displaying advertisements</li>
            <li>Google Sign-In and Google Drive backup/restore</li>
            <li>App version checking (to notify you of updates)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We do not transmit your expense data over the internet except when you explicitly choose to back up to Google Drive.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Notifications</h2>
        <p>
            Expenza may request notification permission to:

            <li>Notify you about app updates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can disable notifications at any time through your device settings.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data to third parties.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your expense data remains on your device unless you explicitly choose to back it up. 
            When you back up to Google Drive, the data is stored in your own Google Drive account, 
            which is governed by Google's privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            You can delete your data at any time by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deleting individual expenses, categories, or payment modes within the app</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the app (this will delete all local data)</li>
            <li>Deleting backup files from your device or Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once deleted, data cannot be recovered unless you have a backup.
        </p>

        </p>
